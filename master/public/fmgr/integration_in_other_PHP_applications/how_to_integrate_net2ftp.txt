This small document gives some hints on how to integrate net2ftp in another
PHP application.

For integration in Drupal, Mambo or Xoops, please refer to readme.txt document 
in the respective subdirectories - there is no need to read the hints below.

-----

First of all, look at the source code of /net2ftp/index.php, this should give 
you an idea on which are the integration hooks. 

Basically:
- call net2ftp("sendHttpHeaders") where the headers are sent in the other application
- call net2ftp("printJavascript") and net2ftp("printCSS") in the HTML head 
  section, to include Javascript code files and CSS style sheets
- call net2ftp("printBodyOnload") in the HTML body tag
- call net2ftp("printBody") to print the HTML body

Note that net2ftp("sendHttpHeaders") MUST be called first, as the 
initialization is done at this stage.

Some specific changes to the net2ftp code may have to be made.
For Mambo, Xoops and Drupal, these are located in the following files:
- /net2ftp/includes/registerglobals.inc.php: to register specific variables
- /skins/skins.inc.php: to add a specific skin to the list of skins
