NET2FTP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

(For upgrade instructions read below.)

To view the detailed installation instructions, open the /files_to_upload/help.html 
file in a browser, and click on Administrator.

In a few words:

1 - Unzip all the files on your computer, and upload them to your web server.

2 - The /temp directory should be chmodded to 777. 

3 - Set your settings in the settings.inc.php file. Geoblocking can be configured
    in settings_authorizations.inc.php.

4 - A database is only required if you want to log the actions of the users,  
    if you want to enable the daily consumption limit or for geoblocking. 
    To create the tables, execute the SQL queries in the "create_tables.sql" 
    file. This can be done easily in PhpMyAdmin, the popular front-end to MySQL.

5 - To enable the FTP module of PHP on Windows: first make sure that your PHP
    directory has been added to the path environment variable. 
    Once this is done, add "extension=ftp" to the php.ini file and restart your 
    webserver.
    
Enjoy!

UPGRADE

net2ftp cannot really be "upgraded" - simply delete the old files on your web 
server, and follow the installation instructions above.

If you are using a database for logging, drop the old tables and create new 
ones following the installation instructions. This will delete the existing 
statistics.
